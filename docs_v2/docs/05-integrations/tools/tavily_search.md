# Tavily Search

[Tavily's Search API](https://tavily.com) is a search engine built specifically for AI agents (LLMs), delivering real-time, accurate, and factual results at speed.

## Setup

The integration lives in the `langchain-community` package. We also need to install the `tavily-python` package itself.

```bash
dart pub add langchain langchain_community
```

We also need to set our Tavily API key.
