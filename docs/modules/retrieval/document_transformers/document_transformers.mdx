# Document transformers

Once you've loaded documents, you'll often want to transform them to better suit
your application. The simplest example is you may want to split a long document
into smaller chunks that can fit into your model's context window. LangChain has
a number of built-in document transformers that make it easy to split, combine,
filter, and otherwise manipulate documents.

## Text splitters

When you want to deal with long pieces of text, it is necessary to split up that
text into chunks. As simple as this sounds, there is a lot of potential
complexity here. Ideally, you want to keep the semantically related pieces of
text together. What "semantically related" means could depend on the type of
text. This tutorial showcases several ways to do that.

At a high level, text splitters work as following:

1. Split the text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often
   sentences).
2. Start combining these small chunks into a larger chunk until you reach a
   certain size (as measured by some function).
3. Once you reach that size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then
   start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap (to keep context between
   chunks).

That means there are two different axes along which you can customize your text
splitter:

1. How the text is split.
2. How the chunk size is measured.

## Get started with text splitters

The most basic text splitter is the `CharacterTextSplitter`. This splits based
on characters (by default `\n\n`) and measure chunk length by number of
characters.

The default recommended text splitter is the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. This text splitter 
takes a list of characters. It tries to create chunks based on splitting on the first character, 
but if any chunks are too large it then moves onto the next character, and so forth. By default 
the characters it tries to split on are `["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]`.

In addition to controlling which characters you can split on, you can also
control a few other things:

- `lengthFunction`: how the length of chunks is calculated. Defaults to just
  counting number of characters, but it's pretty common to pass a token counter
  here.
- `chunkSize`: the maximum size of your chunks (as measured by the length
  function).
- `chunkOverlap`: the maximum overlap between chunks. It can be nice to have
  some overlap to maintain some continuity between chunks (eg do a sliding
  window).
- `addStartIndex`: whether to include the starting position of each chunk within
  the original document in the metadata.

```dart
const filePath = 'state_of_the_union.txt';
const loader = TextLoader(filePath);
final documents = await loader.load();
const textSplitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
  chunkSize: 800,
  chunkOverlap: 0,
);
final docs = textSplitter.splitDocuments(documents);
```
