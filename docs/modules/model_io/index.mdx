# Model I/O

The core element of any language model application is...the model. LangChain gives you the building blocks to interface with any language model.

- [Prompts](/modules/model_io/prompts): templatize, dynamically 
  select, and manage model inputs.
- [Language models](/modules/model_io/models): make calls to language 
  models through common interfaces.
- [Output parsers](/modules/model_io/output_parsers): extract 
  information from model outputs.
