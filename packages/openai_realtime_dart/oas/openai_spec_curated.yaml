            Activation threshold for VAD (0.0 to 1.0), this defaults to 0.5. A

          description: |
            Duration of silence to detect speech stop (in milliseconds). Defaults

            (e.g. "be extremely succinct", "act friendly", "here are examples of good 
            responses") and on audio behavior (e.g. "talk quickly", "inject emotion

            to be followed by the model, but they provide guidance to the model on the 
            desired behavior.

        Send this event to truncate a previous assistant message's audio. The server will produce audio faster
        than realtime, so this event is useful when the user interrupts to truncate audio that has already
        been sent to the client but not yet played. This will synchronize the server's understanding of the
        audio with the client's playback.

        Truncating audio will delete the server-side text transcript to ensure there is not text in the
        context that hasn't been heard by the user.

        If successful, the server will respond with a `conversation.item.truncated` event.

        Send this event to append audio bytes to the input audio buffer. The audio buffer is temporary storage

        the server will decide when to commit. When Server VAD is disabled, you must commit the audio buffer
        manually.

        The client may choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum of 15 MiB, for example
        streaming smaller chunks from the client may allow the VAD to be more responsive. Unlike made other
        client events, the server will not send a confirmation response to this event.

        Committing the input audio buffer will trigger input audio transcription (if enabled in session

        A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case the second will be a
        function call. These Items will be appended to the conversation history.

        The server will respond with a `response.created` event, events for Items and content created, and
        finally a `response.done` event to indicate the Response is complete.

        The `response.create` event includes inference configuration like `instructions`, and `temperature`.
        These fields will override the Session's configuration for this Response only.

    RealtimeEventConversationItemInputAudioTranscriptionCompleted:

        This event is the output of audio transcription for user audio written to the user audio buffer.
        Transcription begins when the input audio buffer is committed by the client or server (in `server_vad`
        mode). Transcription runs asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or
        after the Response events.

        Realtime API models accept audio natively, and thus input transcription is a separate process run on a
        separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model, currently always `whisper-1`. Thus the transcript
        may diverge somewhat from the model's interpretation, and should be treated as a rough guide.
