            Input messages.

            Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
            conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
            conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates
            the next `Message` in the conversation.

            Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
            specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
            `assistant` messages. The first message must always use the `user` role.

            If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
            continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
            constrain part of the model's response.
            
            See [message content](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-content) for
            details on how to construct valid message objects.

            Example with a single `user` message:

            ```json
            [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
            ```

            Example with multiple conversational turns:

            ```json
            [
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
              { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
              { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
            ]
            ```

            Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
              },
              { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
            ]
            ```

            Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
            content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for
            `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The
            following input messages are equivalent:

            ```json
            { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
            ```

            ```json
            { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
            ```

            Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

            ```json
            {
              "role": "user",
              "content": [
                {
                  "type": "image",
                  "source": {
                    "type": "base64",
                    "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                    "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg..."
                  }
                },
                { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" }
              ]
            }
            ```

            We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`,
            `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

            See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples) for more
            input examples.

            Note that if you want to include a
            [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use
            the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input
            messages in the Messages API.

            Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter
            only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

            Different models have different maximum values for this parameter. See

            Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn,
            which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

            If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of
            text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of
            the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"`
            and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

            Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0`
            for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and
            generative tasks.

            Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully
            deterministic.

        tools:
          type: array
          description: |
            Definitions of tools that the model may use.
            
            If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use`
            content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run
            those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally
            return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.
            
            Each tool definition includes:
            
            - `name`: Name of the tool.
            - `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
            - `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) for the tool `input`
              shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.
            
            For example, if you defined `tools` as:
            
            ```json
            [
              {
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                "input_schema": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                    "ticker": {
                      "type": "string",
                      "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                    }
                  },
                  "required": ["ticker"]
                }
              }
            ]
            ```
            
            And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
            `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:
            
            ```json
            [
              {
                "type": "tool_use",
                "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
              }
            ]
            ```
            
            You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an
            input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user`
            message:
            
            ```json
            [
              {
                "type": "tool_result",
                "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                "content": "259.75 USD"
              }
            ]
            ```
            
            Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and
            functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular
            JSON structure of output.

        Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the
        underlying cost to our systems.
        
        Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the
        model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an
        API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one
        with the exact visible content of an API request or response.
        
        For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response
        from Claude.
