/// Billing and rate-limit usage.
///
/// Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the
/// underlying cost to our systems.
///
/// Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the
/// model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an
/// API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one
/// with the exact visible content of an API request or response.
///
/// For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response
/// from Claude.
