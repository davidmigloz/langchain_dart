/// Tests documenting the Phase 2 limitation that auth tokens are NOT refreshed
/// during retry attempts.
///
/// **PHASE 2 ARCHITECTURAL LIMITATION**:
/// - Auth is applied ONCE by AuthInterceptor before retry chain begins
/// - Retry wraps the transport layer (RetryWrapper), not in interceptor chain
/// - If token expires between retry attempts, stale token is reused
/// - This is INTENTIONAL Phase 2 design, not a bug
///
/// **WHY**: Retry wraps transport execution, auth runs before. To support token
/// refresh during retries, RetryInterceptor would need to be in the chain AFTER
/// AuthInterceptor (planned for Phase 3+).
///
/// **TESTING NOTE**: These are documentation tests. Full integration testing of
/// retry/auth interaction is complex due to the architecture (retry wraps transport,
/// auth in interceptor chain). The unit tests for RetryInterceptor and AuthInterceptor
/// verify their individual behaviors correctly.

        // 1. AuthInterceptor adds auth headers/params before request
        // 2. Request enters retry wrapper with auth already applied
        // 3. If retry happens, same auth is used for all attempts
        // 4. No token refresh mechanism exists in Phase 2
        //
        // EXAMPLE SCENARIO:
        // - Initial request: API key "key123" added by AuthInterceptor
        // - Request fails with 429 rate limit
        // - Retry attempt 1: Uses same "key123" (no refresh)
        // - Retry attempt 2: Uses same "key123" (no refresh)
