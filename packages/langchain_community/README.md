## What is it?

LangChain.dart Community contains third-party integrations that implement the base interfaces defined in LangChain.dart Core, making them ready-to-use in any LangChain.dart application.

The most popular third-party integrations have their own packages (e.g. [langchain_openai](https://pub.dev/packages/langchain_openai), [langchain_google](https://pub.dev/packages/langchain_google), etc.). Check out the [full list of packages](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart?tab=readme-ov-file#packages).

For full documentation see the [API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/langchain_community/latest/).
